# penGui

An immediate-mode library written in Rust

To install Rust and everything needed, and run the example :

- Install rust. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- If rust is already installed, make sure that your toolchain version is >=1.47.0
- Clone this repository
- To run the example, use the command `cargo run --example glium-experimental`
- Eat some cookies while it compiles (it might take two or three minutes to gather all packages necessary and to compile everything)


Inside the example:
- move the mouse to move the camera around, use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Clicks are not yet implemented.
- The two rectangles at the middle are buttons, but they are not clickable yet. Buttons support colors and textures.
